# Entwicklerheld_isAnagram_Challenge
## Write a function that takes two words as an argument and returns true if they are anagrams (contain the exact same letters) and false otherwise. 

**Scenario 1:** Yes, it is an anagram!
Given are two Strings `"eat"` and `"tea"` .
The function `isAnagram()` called with these Strings should return `true` .
This should work with other anagrams as well. Word pairs of the same word are anagrams as well in this challenge.

**Scenario 2:** No, it is not!



Given are two Strings `"are"` and `"ears"` .
The function `isAnagram()` called with these Strings should return `false` .
This should work with other examples as well.

## Comments
I wrote this programm to ignore Upper and Lowercase. So whatever String enters the Methode, it will compare the strings correctly.


Exempel_1: Tea and tea would return `true`.


Example_2: SpOrT and ToRpS would still return true!
